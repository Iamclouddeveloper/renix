        <p data-animate="fade-in-left">
        As part of their digital progression, Derby Hindu Temple required a structured digital
        foundation to manage data efficiently, improve transparency, and make temple information
        accessible in a modern and interactive format. RENIX (UK) introduced a scalable system focusing
        on cloud solutions, digital archiving, and virtual temple experiences.
