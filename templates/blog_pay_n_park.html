        <h2 class="mb-3" data-animate="fade-in-left">Project Overview</h2>
        <p data-animate="fade-in-left">
        Pay N Park was conceptualised to remove the complexity associated with finding parking, reducing
        congestion, and offering businesses a structured system to manage their parking infrastructure.
        The application provides a unified experience for users to locate, reserve, and pay for parking
        spaces through a fully automated workflow.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mb-3" data-animate="fade-in-left">Core Objectives</h2>
        <ul class="list-group mb-4">
        <li class="list-group-item" data-animate="fade-in-left">Provide real-time visibility of available parking spots.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" data-animate="fade-in-left">Enable seamless reservation and automated payment processing.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" data-animate="fade-in-left">Reduce on-site congestion and manual handling for commercial operators.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" data-animate="fade-in-left">Improve user experience through intuitive design and personalisation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mb-3" data-animate="fade-in-left">Key Functional Features</h2>

        <h3 class="mb-3" data-animate="fade-in-left">Real-Time Parking Availability</h3>
        <p data-animate="fade-in-left">
        The system integrates live occupancy tracking to present users with up-to-date information on
        available parking spaces. This helps minimise unnecessary driving and improves parking turnover
        for commercial operators.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mb-3" data-animate="fade-in-left">Advance Reservation & Smart Payments</h3>
        <p data-animate="fade-in-left">
        Users can pre-book their parking slots for business meetings, shopping visits, or daily use.
        The built-in payment engine supports multiple secure methods, enabling fast cashless transactions
        without the need for meters or manual ticketing.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mb-3" data-animate="fade-in-left">Navigation & Route Assistance</h3>
        <p data-animate="fade-in-left">
        GPS-driven navigation guides users directly to their designated space, reducing confusion in
        large parking structures and improving arrival flow within commercial premises.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mb-3" data-animate="fade-in-left">User Personalisation</h3>
        <p data-animate="fade-in-left">
        The application stores frequently used locations, payment preferences, and reminder settings.
        This personalised experience enhances convenience and helps users optimise their routine travel.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mb-3" data-animate="fade-in-left">Impact & Outcomes</h2>
        <p data-animate="fade-in-left">
        Pay N Park has significantly streamlined parking workflows for users and commercial partners.
        Real-time insights, digital payments, and improved navigation contribute to reduced congestion
        and greater parking efficiency. The platform’s scalable architecture ensures adaptability as
        user demand and commercial requirements grow.
