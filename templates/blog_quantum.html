      Quantum Computing: Breaking Barriers
    </h1>
    <p class="text-muted mb-4">
      Exploring the potential of quantum computers to solve complex global challenges.
    </p>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      Quantum computing represents one of the most groundbreaking technological 
      advancements of our era. Unlike classical computers that rely on binary bits 
      (0s and 1s), quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states 
      simultaneously. This unique capability unlocks immense computational power, 
      paving the way for solving problems once thought unsolvable.

    <!-- How Quantum Computing Works -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">How Quantum Computing Works</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      At the heart of quantum computing lie principles such as superposition and 
      entanglement. These phenomena allow quantum systems to process vast amounts 
      of information in parallel. As a result, they can explore complex solution 
      spaces at speeds unattainable by traditional computers, offering transformative 
      possibilities for science, business, and society.
    </p>

    <!-- Potential Applications -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Potential Applications</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      The potential applications of quantum computing extend across diverse industries:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-muted">
      <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Accelerating drug discovery and simulating molecules for innovative treatments.</li>
      <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Optimising investment portfolios and enhancing risk management models.</li>
      <li><strong>Climate Science:</strong> Modelling environmental systems to predict and mitigate the impacts of climate change.</li>
      <li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Developing next-generation encryption methods, while also challenging current cryptographic standards.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Challenges -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Challenges Ahead</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      Despite its promise, quantum computing faces considerable challenges. 
      Building stable qubits, minimising error rates, and scaling systems remain 
      formidable hurdles. In addition, the high costs and specialised environments 
      required for quantum machines mean that mainstream adoption is likely to be 
      gradual rather than immediate.
    </p>

    <!-- Future Outlook -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">The Future of Quantum Computing</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      As research advances, quantum computing is expected to evolve from experimental 
      prototypes into practical, real-world applications. With substantial investment 
      from governments, academic institutions, and technology leaders, the coming 
      decade could see quantum systems making meaningful contributions to solving 
      humanity’s greatest challenges, from medical breakthroughs to environmental 
      sustainability.
    </p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      Quantum computing is more than an evolution in technology. it is a revolution. 
      By transcending the limitations of classical systems, it holds the potential to 
      reshape industries, accelerate scientific discovery, and address complex global 
      issues. The journey is still in its early stages, but its impact is set to be 
      profound and far-reaching.
