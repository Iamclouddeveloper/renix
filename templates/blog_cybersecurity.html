      Cybersecurity in the Digital Age: Protecting Businesses and Customers
    </h1>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="text-white">
      In today’s hyper-connected world, cybersecurity has become one of the most critical pillars of business resilience. 
      Across industries, from financial services to retail, organisations face increasingly complex threats that can disrupt operations, 
      compromise sensitive data, and erode customer trust. At RENIX (UK) Limited, we support businesses in building 
      robust security frameworks that safeguard assets and maintain stakeholder confidence.

    <!-- Challenges -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">The Cybersecurity Challenge</h3>
    <ul class="text-white">
      <li><strong>Growing Sophistication:</strong> Cybercriminals now deploy artificial intelligence, automation, and social engineering to bypass traditional defences.</li>
      <li><strong>Remote Work Risks:</strong> Decentralised and hybrid working environments have created multiple points of vulnerability.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Privacy Regulations:</strong> Legislation such as GDPR requires strict compliance, with significant financial penalties for breaches.</li>
      <li><strong>Supply Chain Weaknesses:</strong> Third-party vendors often introduce unmonitored risks into enterprise systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Solutions -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Cybersecurity Solutions for Enterprises</h3>
    <ul class="text-white">
