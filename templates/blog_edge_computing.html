      Edge Computing: Bringing Data Closer
    </h1>
    <p class="text-muted mb-4">
      Why edge computing is becoming critical for real-time decision-making.
    </p>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      In today’s digital economy, where timely insights can define competitive advantage, 
      <strong>edge computing</strong> is emerging as a transformative solution. Rather than relying solely 
      on centralised cloud servers, edge computing processes data closer to the source—whether through 
      sensors, IoT devices, or local networks. This approach significantly reduces latency, enhances 
      efficiency, and enables faster decision-making.
    </p>

    <!-- Why Edge Computing Matters -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Why Edge Computing Matters</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      Traditional cloud computing often struggles with latency and bandwidth limitations, 
      particularly as billions of connected devices generate vast amounts of data. 
      Edge computing addresses these challenges by processing information locally and 
      transmitting only the most essential data to the cloud. This capability allows organisations 
      to act instantly, which is especially valuable in industries where milliseconds can determine outcomes.
    </p>

    <!-- Key Applications -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Key Applications of Edge Computing</h3>
    <ul class="text-muted">
      <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Real-time patient monitoring using wearable devices with immediate local data analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles:</strong> On-the-spot navigation and safety decisions without reliance on remote servers.</li>
      <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Smart factories using predictive maintenance and quality control powered by edge systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Retail:</strong> Personalised in-store experiences delivered through AI applications running at the edge.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Challenges -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Challenges of Edge Computing</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      While the benefits are clear, edge computing also presents challenges. 
      Ensuring security across distributed networks is complex, and seamless integration 
      with existing cloud infrastructures requires careful planning. Furthermore, scaling 
      and managing edge deployments demand new technical skills, governance frameworks, 
      and architectural strategies.
    </p>

    <!-- Future Outlook -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">The Future of Edge Computing</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      As enabling technologies such as 5G, AI, and IoT mature, edge computing will 
      increasingly become a fundamental part of digital ecosystems. Its adoption will 
      accelerate the development of:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-muted">
      <li>Smart cities powered by real-time data flows.</li>
      <li>Advanced robotics capable of autonomous decision-making.</li>
      <li>Immersive AR/VR experiences with minimal latency.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-muted">
      Collectively, these innovations will deliver capabilities and experiences 
      that were previously out of reach.
    </p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      Edge computing is not simply an extension of cloud computing—it represents a 
      fundamental shift in digital architecture. By processing data closer to its source, 
      it empowers businesses and individuals to make faster, smarter, and more reliable decisions. 
      In an era where speed and responsiveness drive success, edge computing is becoming 
      essential to unlocking the next wave of digital transformation.
