    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      The Internet of Things (IoT) is reshaping how we interact with our environment. 
      From smart homes and wearable devices to industrial automation and connected cities, 
      IoT bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds. With billions of devices 
      already connected, IoT is accelerating innovation and redefining operational models 
      across industries.
    </p>

    <!-- Opportunities -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Opportunities with IoT</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      IoT presents significant opportunities for both businesses and consumers, creating 
      new efficiencies and driving innovation:

    </ul>

    <!-- Challenges -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Challenges of IoT</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      While the benefits are clear, IoT adoption comes with challenges that organisations 
      must address strategically:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-muted">
      <li><strong>Security and Privacy:</strong> The vast number of connected devices creates vulnerabilities that need strong safeguards.</li>
      <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Ensuring seamless communication between diverse devices remains a persistent challenge.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Managing and expanding large IoT networks requires robust infrastructure and governance frameworks.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Future Outlook -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">The Future of IoT</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      The future of IoT lies in its convergence with emerging technologies such as 5G, 
      artificial intelligence (AI), and edge computing. Faster connectivity and intelligent 
      algorithms will enable IoT to deliver actionable real-time insights, driving 
      breakthroughs in:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-muted">
      <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles:</strong> Safer and more efficient transportation networks.</li>
      <li><strong>Intelligent Supply Chains:</strong> Enhanced visibility and optimisation of logistics.</li>
      <li><strong>Hyper-connected Communities:</strong> Smarter living environments and urban ecosystems.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h3 class="mb-3">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="text-muted">
      IoT is no longer a futuristic concept – it is a reality that is transforming the way we 
      live and work today. Organisations that embrace IoT will unlock unprecedented 
      efficiencies, customer experiences, and growth opportunities. However, achieving its 
      full potential requires addressing challenges proactively, with security, governance, 
      and innovation placed firmly at the core of every strategy.
